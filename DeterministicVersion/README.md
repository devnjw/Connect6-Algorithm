# Connect6

## Intro
- The idea of this project is to create a strong bot to play the game of connect6
- As a first step, a GUI with a deterministic bot was programmed
- Now, the plan is to apply machine learning techniques insted of the deterministic one

## Structure
- spiel.py is the main script
- game_class.py contains all the game specific classes
- bot_class.py contains the class for the moves of the bot
- gameX (X is a number) are files which contain information about a single game
